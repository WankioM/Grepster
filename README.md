# Grepster  

**Grepster** is like `grep`, but... Rustier. It searches for text in files because, well, that's what it does.  

##  Features  
- **Find words in files** (because reading is hard).  
- **Uses colors** (so you feel fancy).  


## Usage  
```sh
cargo run search_term daobitat.txt
```
or, if you trust me enough to install it:  
```sh
./grepster search_term daobitat.txt
```
(But let’s be honest, you’ll probably `cargo run` every time.)  

## Why?  
Because every programmer must write a `grep` clone at some point.
