Sign here, sign there, sign away your soul.
The deed is yours, or so you are told.
A paper that whispers, a paper that grins,
A paper that vanishes in government winds.

They say, "It’s secure! It’s been verified!"
They say, "It’s your right, it cannot be denied!"
They say, "It’s the law, the law of the land!"
But the law is a shadow that slips through your hand.

Sign here, sign there, sign away your breath.
The ink is dry, but the home is a theft.
Sign here, sign there, sign away your doubt.
Sign it, submit it, but never find out.
